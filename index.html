<section class="What creates risk?">
<h2 class="sub1">What creates risk?</h2>
<div class="What creates risk?">
    <p>ESG risks are interconnected and can have cascading effects on a company’s financial performance, operational resilience, and long-term viability. Recognizing the unique drivers for ESG risk in each organization and incorporating strategies to address these risks into business plans, risk management processes, and corporate culture will optimize sustainable growth. The ESG risk drivers that every organization should consider include:</p>
    <section class="Products"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Products</h3>
    <div class="Products">
        <p>Each product a company produces or sells will have its own specific ESG requirements and risk profile. These might include, for example, requirements or risks related to sustainable sourcing, energy efficiency, waste reduction, employment practices, community engagement, health and safety practices or ethical business practices. Product requirements might be set out in regulation, guidance issued by industry bodies, or in the product’s terms and conditions, all of which must be understood and complied with. Companies must also consider customer and public expectations, which should be assessed and addressed on a product-by-product basis.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Services"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Services</h3>
    <div class="Services">
        <p>The provision and purchase of services – even services which are, on their face, unrelated to ESG – can give rise to ESG-related risks. Identifying such risks requires careful consideration of services’ purpose, design, delivery and impact. Once the risks are identified, companies must carefully consider and proactively manage ESG risks to uphold ethical standards, maintain regulatory compliance, and safeguard the well-being of stakeholders and the environment. For example, services may give rise to the risk of breaching ESG-related regulations unless the service is designed and delivered in accordance with those regulations. Companies purchasing services from other providers may also be required to consider those providers’ ESG risks to ensure supply chain compliance.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Operations"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Operations</h3>
    <div class="Operations">
        <p>ESG-related operations risk arises from the way in which businesses are run, including how products are managed and how services are provided. These could include activities which damage the environment, supply chain management, workers who are not paid a fair wage, services which adversely impact communities, or associations with a third party who is involved in illegal activities such as bribery. Understanding exactly what a company’s operations entail, identifying areas where ESG-related risk could arise, and purposefully addressing those areas, is critical.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Advertising"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Advertising</h3>
    <div class="Advertising">
        <p>The ESG-related risks arising from advertising are high on companies’ agendas. Regulators are increasingly focused on greenwashing in advertising, where claims of “green” (or other ESG-related) credentials or benefits are unjustified, or present an incomplete or uncontextualized picture of a company’s activities. In order to mitigate this risk, it is important for companies to be able to evidence any ESG-related claims, and to demonstrate that those claims are appropriate in light of the totality of the firm’s activities.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Data"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Data</h3>
    <div class="Data">
        <p>Data related to a firm’s ESG-related performance, as well as its ESG-related advertising, are under increasing scrutiny. Governments and regulators worldwide are mandating more and more disclosure of ESG-related information, including in relation to net zero transition, gender pay gap, and board composition. Published data can then be monitored and tracked by other third parties, including parties who may seek to challenge a firm’s ESG-related efforts. Firms need to be able to access, collate and understand their data in order to be able to comply with regulatory requirements and to address any challenges.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Legal and Regulatory"></section>
    <h3 class="sub11">Legal and Regulatory</h3>
    <div class="Legal and Regulatory">
        <p>Governments and regulators worldwide have legislated and regulated on ESG topics for many years but the pace of change in this area over the last few years has been exponential. Companies are having to comply with increasing amounts of regulation, particularly relating to climate. In addition, governments and regulators tend to act unilaterally, so regulations in different countries are not consistent and, in some cases, contradict each other. This can generate significant risk, particularly where such regulations have extra-territorial effect. Monitoring the pipeline 
            of new legislation and regulation is crucial.</p>

<h2 class="sub2">Risk management tools</h2>
<div class="Risk management tools">
    <p>An understanding of the multifaceted drivers behind ESG risk is essential, but what can organizations do to actually mitigate and manage that risk? Some tools include:</p>
    <section class="Disclosure">
    <h3 class="sub21">Disclosure</h3>
    <div class="Disclosure">
        <p>Effective disclosure practices involve transparent and accurate communication of ESG information to stakeholders, including regulators, investors, lenders, employees and customers, taking into account evolving voluntary and mandatory reporting regimes in different jurisdictions around the world. By providing comprehensive data on ESG performance, companies enhance trust, credibility, and accountability, crucial for managing ESG risks, while also being better prepared to adapt to new mandatory reporting regulations that may come into effect. Transparent disclosure enables stakeholders to assess a company's sustainability efforts, understand potential risks and opportunities, and make informed decisions. It also promotes dialogue and engagement with stakeholders, fostering a culture of transparency and responsibility within the organization. Moreover, robust disclosure practices help mitigate reputational risks associated with ESG controversies or non-compliance, ultimately safeguarding long-term value creation and stakeholder trust.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Compliance"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Compliance</h3>
    <div class="Compliance">
        <p>Compliance with evolving ESG regulations, standards, and best practices is essential for managing ESG risks effectively. By adhering to relevant laws, regulations, and industry guidelines, companies demonstrate their commitment to ethical conduct, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility. Compliance helps mitigate legal and regulatory risks associated with ESG non-compliance, including fines, penalties, and legal actions, including greenwashing claims. Moreover, it enhances reputational resilience by signaling to stakeholders that the company operates with integrity and accountability. Establishing robust compliance processes and systems enables companies to identify, assess, and mitigate ESG risks proactively, fostering trust and confidence among investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Reporting"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Reporting</h3>
    <div class="Reporting">
        <p>ESG reporting is a fundamental tool for managing ESG risks, providing stakeholders with transparent, consistent and comparable information regarding a company's ESG performance, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. By disclosing relevant ESG data, companies enhance transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement, enabling informed decision-making and risk assessment. Comprehensive ESG reporting allows stakeholders to evaluate a company's sustainability performance, identify areas for improvement, and compare performance against industry peers and benchmarks. Moreover, it demonstrates a commitment to responsible business practices and long-term value creation, enhancing trust and credibility with investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders. Implementing robust reporting practices, including the use of internationally recognized frameworks and standards, strengthens the company's reputation and resilience to ESG-related risks and opportunities.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Due Diligence"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Due Diligence</h3>
    <div class="Due Diligence">
        <p>Conducting thorough due diligence on ESG issues is critical for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with business activities, investments, joint ventures and partnerships, and evaluating how such risks may impact an entity’s future strategy, business model and financial outlook. By assessing ESG factors, companies can identify potential risks, such as climate transition and adaption, environmental pollution, human rights violations, or governance failures, and take proactive measures to mitigate them. Due diligence also helps uncover opportunities for value creation, such as energy efficiency improvements, climate resilience planning, sustainable supply chain practices, or social impact initiatives. Integrating ESG due diligence into decision-making processes enables companies to make informed choices that align with sustainability goals, mitigate risks, and enhance long-term value creation for stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Investment"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Investment</h3>
    <div class="Investment">
        <p>Integrating ESG factors into investment procedures is essential for managing ESG risks effectively and aligning investment strategies with sustainability goals. By considering ESG criteria in investment decision-making, companies can identify investment opportunities that promote long-term value creation while mitigating potential risks. ESG integration helps investors assess the sustainability performance of companies and investment portfolios, enabling them to make informed decisions that account for both financial and non-financial considerations. Moreover, incorporating ESG factors into investment procedures promotes responsible investing practices, fosters sustainable development, and enhances stakeholder trust and confidence. Implementing robust investment procedures that incorporate ESG criteria strengthens risk management practices, improves investment outcomes, and contributes to a more sustainable and resilient financial system. As ESG compliance and performance are integrated into investment systems and risk processes, a company seeking investment that has strong ESG credentials is more likely to attract investors, raise finance and may be able to leverage its ESG performance to influence the terms and cost of financing offered.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Ongoing Portafolio management"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Ongoing Portafolio management</h3>
    <div class="Ongoing Portafolio management">
        <p>Ongoing portfolio management is essential for effectively managing ESG risks and opportunities within investment portfolios over time. By continuously monitoring and evaluating ESG performance, companies can identify emerging risks, trends, and opportunities that may impact portfolio performance and sustainability outcomes. Ongoing portfolio management allows investors to track ESG metrics, assess the impact of ESG factors on investment returns, and make timely adjustments to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, it facilitates engagement with portfolio companies on ESG issues, encouraging disclosure, transparency, and accountability. By integrating ESG considerations into portfolio management practices, investors can mitigate risks, enhance long-term value creation, and ensure sustainable development.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Standartization"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Standartization</h3>
    <div class="Standartization">
        <p>Standardization of ESG reporting and disclosure practices is essential for promoting transparency, comparability, and accountability across industries and markets. By adopting internationally recognized frameworks, standards, and guidelines, companies can enhance the quality, consistency, and credibility of their ESG reporting efforts. For example, standardized reporting facilitates information being reported consistently from year-to-year, while also being comparable with industry competitors. Standardization enables stakeholders to compare ESG performance metrics, assess industry trends, and benchmark performance against peers, facilitating informed decision-making and risk assessment. Moreover, it promotes dialogue and collaboration among stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of ESG issues and best practices. Implementing standardized ESG reporting practices strengthens the company's reputation, builds investor confidence, and enhances resilience.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Frameworks"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Frameworks</h3>
    <div class="Frameworks">
        <p>Frameworks provide structured approaches for assessing, measuring, and managing ESG risks and opportunities within organizations. By adopting established ESG frameworks and methodologies, companies can effectively identify, prioritize, and address key sustainability issues relevant to their business operations, while being better prepared for the enactment of future mandatory reporting regimes. ESG frameworks offer guidelines, tools, and best practices for integrating ESG considerations into strategic decision-making, risk management, and performance measurement processes. Moreover, frameworks facilitate alignment with international standards and regulatory requirements, enhancing transparency, accountability, and stakeholder trust. Implementing robust ESG frameworks enables companies to enhance their sustainability performance, mitigate risks, and create long-term value for shareholders, employees, customers, and other stakeholders.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Policies"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Policies</h3>
    <div class="Policies">
        <p>ESG policies establish clear expectations, guidelines, and procedures for addressing ESG issues within organizations, and the underlying governance mechanisms for overseeing and monitoring them. By formalizing commitments to responsible business conduct and establishing appropriate internal governance infrastructure, companies can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability, ethics, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. ESG policies provide a framework for integrating sustainability considerations into business strategy, operations, and decision-making processes. They also define roles, responsibilities, and accountability mechanisms for managing ESG risks and opportunities effectively. Moreover, ESG policies promote transparency, consistency, and continuous improvement in sustainability performance, enhancing trust and credibility with stakeholders. Implementing and enforcing ESG policies strengthens the company's reputation, reduces compliance risks, and fosters a culture of responsible business conduct.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="ESG tean building"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">ESG team building</h3>
    <div class="ESG tean building">
        <p>ESG team building involves assembling multidisciplinary teams with expertise in ESG issues to drive sustainability initiatives within organizations. By bringing together diverse perspectives and skills, including knowledge from different relevant functional areas, companies can develop and implement effective ESG strategies and initiatives that address key sustainability challenges and opportunities, while establishing robust internal controls over such matters. ESG teams play a crucial role in integrating sustainability into business operations, engaging stakeholders, and driving innovation. They also facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing across functional areas, fostering a culture of sustainability and responsibility within the organization. Moreover, ESG team building enhances the company's reputation, strengthens stakeholder relationships, and promotes long-term value creation.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Good performance"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Good performance</h3>
    <div class="Good performance">
        <p>Good performance in ESG metrics is essential for managing ESG risks effectively and enhancing stakeholder trust and confidence. By achieving positive outcomes in ESG performance indicators, companies can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability, ethics, and responsible business conduct. Good ESG performance enhances the company's reputation, attracts investors and customers, and mitigates risks associated with poor ESG performance, such as regulatory fines, legal actions, and reputational damage, including to the directors of the entity. Moreover, it fosters a culture of continuous improvement and innovation, driving long-term value creation and competitive advantage. By prioritizing ESG performance, companies can strengthen stakeholder relationships, build resilience to ESG-related risks, and contribute to sustainable development goals.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Training / Education / Engagement"></section>
    <h3 class="sub21">Training / Education / Engagement</h3>
    <div class="Training / Education / Engagement">
        <p>Training, education, and engagement initiatives empower stakeholders with the knowledge, skills, and awareness needed to effectively manage ESG risks and opportunities. By providing training and education on ESG issues, companies can enhance employees understanding of key sustainability challenges, best practices, and emerging trends. Training programs build capacity and expertise within the organization, enabling employees to identify, assess, and mitigate ESG risks proactively, and integrate ESG-related risks into the entity’s overall risk management systems and processes. Moreover, engagement initiatives facilitate dialogue and collaboration with stakeholders, fostering a culture of transparency, trust, and accountability. By engaging with investors, customers, suppliers, and communities, companies can address stakeholder concerns, build consensus around ESG priorities, and drive collective action for positive change. Ultimately, training, education, and engagement initiatives enable companies to build resilience to ESG-related risks, drive sustainable practices, and create long-term value for stakeholders and society.</p>

<section class="Adverse Impacts">
<h2 class="sub3">Adverse Impacts</h2>
<div class="Adverse Impacts">
    <p>Many companies struggle to navigate competing demands by employees, customers, and stakeholders. On the one hand, companies face pressure from progressives who are advocating for companies to be more sustainable, more inclusive, and to take action to support social justice causes. Simultaneously, bending to such pressure can create new risks for companies being labeled by conservatives as “woke” or “ideological.” The consequences and impacts of not meeting these demands can be significant, however effectively navigating these risks will put companies at a significant advantage over their competitors. Some of these impacts include:</p>
    <section class="Reputational damage"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Reputational damage</h3>
    <div class="Reputational damage">
        <p>Negative publicity stemming from ESG controversies can tarnish a company's reputation, erode customer trust, and lead to boycotts or decreased sales. Moreover, such incidents can attract regulatory scrutiny, triggering investigations or penalties that further damage credibility. Reputational damage often translates into tangible financial losses, as investors may divest from companies with tarnished images, lenders may impose stricter terms, and talented employees may seek opportunities elsewhere. Conversely, proactive ESG initiatives can enhance brand value, attract socially conscious investors, and foster long-term sustainability, underscoring the critical importance of effectively managing ESG risks and opportunities in today's business landscape.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Regulatory license operate"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Regulatory license operate</h3>
    <div class="Regulatory license operate">
        <p>Businesses can breach ESG regulations through various actions such as environmental pollution, labor exploitation, or unethical governance practices. Regulatory bodies may respond by imposing fines, sanctions, or even revoking operating licenses, effectively halting business operations. For instance, companies found guilty of significant environmental violations may face closure or severe restrictions on their activities to mitigate harm to the environment and public health. Similarly, businesses engaging in unethical labor practices risk being banned from operating in certain jurisdictions or facing boycotts from consumers and investors, leading to financial losses and reputational damage that hinder their ability to continue operations.</p>
        <p>Throughout the United States, state laws are being introduced to regulate ESG-related business operations. For example, in 2021, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the “Energy Discrimination Elimination Act” into law to place certain financial companies that allegedly boycott the energy sector onto a state-wide blacklist. On the other hand, certain so-called “blue states” have enacted legislation that requires the utilization of ESG considerations and have barred pension fund investments in the fossil fuel industry.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Social license to operate"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Social license to operate</h3>
    <div class="Social license to operate">
        <p>Businesses that breach ESG regulations or are underperforming in the ESG space can trigger social pressure that impedes their ability to operate. Instances of environmental degradation, human rights abuses, or discriminatory practices can provoke public outrage and activism. Not only have customers used their purchasing power to protest these policies, social pressure may manifest through boycotts, protests, or viral social media campaigns, damaging the company's reputation and eroding consumer trust. Consequently, businesses face declining sales, investor divestment, and difficulty attracting talent, which can ultimately lead to financial instability and operational challenges. The power of social pressure highlights the growing importance of aligning business practices with societal values to maintain legitimacy and sustain long-term success in an increasingly socially conscious world.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Loss of investors"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Loss of investors</h3>
    <div class="Loss of investors">
        <p>When businesses breach ESG regulations, they risk losing investors, profoundly impacting their operations. Investors increasingly consider ESG factors in their decision-making, and violations can lead to divestment, delisting, decreased stock value, restricted access to capital markets or outright bans. Asset managers must remain vigilant and attentive to the ESG landscape in the markets in which they conduct business. Loss of investor confidence diminishes financial resources for expansion, research, and innovation. Additionally, reputational damage stemming from ESG breaches can deter potential investors, exacerbating the company's financial woes. This investor flight not only hampers immediate growth prospects but also undermines the company's long-term viability, underscoring the critical importance of ESG compliance for sustainable business success.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Loss of financing"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Loss of financing</h3>
    <div class="Loss of financing">
        <p>As ideological and politically motivated actors seek to force businesses to choose whether they are “anti-ESG” or “pro-ESG,” the manner in which debt financiers evaluate risk may shift. Businesses risk losing access to finance, significantly impacting their operations. Financial institutions and lenders increasingly integrate ESG criteria into their lending decisions, and non-compliance can lead to higher borrowing costs, loan denials, or even loan recalls. Limited access to finance constrains the company's ability to fund operations, invest in growth initiatives, or navigate financial challenges. Moreover, reputational damage from ESG violations can deter potential financiers, exacerbating the company's financial strain. This loss of financial support undermines the company's resilience and growth prospects, highlighting the imperative of ESG compliance for securing sustainable financing options.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Loss of share value"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Loss of share value</h3>
    <div class="Loss of share value">
        <p>Businesses can risk losing share value, significantly impacting their business. ESG violations can trigger investor concerns, leading to share price declines as investors reassess the company’s risk profile and long-term prospects. Decreased share value undermines the company’s market capitalization, reducing its ability to raise capital, pursue acquisitions, or incentivize employees through stock options. Additionally, a decline in share price may erode shareholder confidence and attract activist investors seeking changes in management or strategic direction. The loss of share value underscores the financial repercussions of ESG non-compliance and the importance of maintaining stakeholder trust for sustained business success.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Damage and penalties"></section>
    <h3 class="sub31">Damage and penalties</h3>
    <div class="Damage and penalties">
        <p>Lawsuits brought by activists, governments, regulators, and private parties can create significant financial burdens for companies. Indeed, the costs of defending investigations, enforcement actions, and suits are substantial. High-profile greenwashing suits have resulted in $30 billion-dollar settlements. Further, simply filing a “new case or a court decision against a company can reduce its expected value by an average of 0.41%” (per a 2023 LSE’s Grantham Research Institute study). Lawsuits are not limited to environmental or greenwashing-related claims. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, took action against a company over its failure to properly mitigate certain social or employee-related retention risks, which resulted in a $35 million settlement.</p>

<div class="Recourse routes">
    <h2 class="sub41">US</h2>
    <p>Stakeholders and actors can call on an arsenal of recourse routes to attempt to address ESG related concerns. In the United States, some of the most significant include:</p>
    
    <section class="Class action"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Class action</h3>
    <div class="Class action">
        <p>Class actions play a prominent role in ESG litigation in the U.S.. In greenwashing cases, plaintiffs have claimed companies’ misrepresentations concerning their environmental or other ESG practices caused classes of consumers to pay too much for products.  Plaintiffs challenging DEI practices or asserting claims based on labor conditions in supply chains also have invoked the class action procedure in recent cases.  Because few, if any, cases from the current wave of ESG litigation have progressed to class certification, it remains to be seen how successful these cases will be.  In the meantime, we expect plaintiffs to continue filing ESG class actions, so companies should be aware and prepared.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Shareholder activism"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Shareholder activism</h3>
    <div class="Shareholder activism">
        <p>U.S. shareholder activism on ESG is widespread and controversial. Shareholder proposals are a major component here. Resolutions addressing governance are nothing new, but there has been a recent increase in environmental and social proposals. Many have sought to require disclosure of information on climate risk and transition. Others have focused on DEI, labor, or other social issues. These have come from both right and left and have generated attention from members of Congress and state attorneys’ general, as well as litigation.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Regulatory actions"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Regulatory actions</h3>
    <div class="Regulatory actions">
        <p>ESG regulatory action is on the increase. The high-profile SEC climate rule has garnered substantial attention but is just one example of ESG regulatory action.  For example, the Department of Labor adopted a rule allowing employers to consider ESG in retirement investments.  That regulation survived a legal challenge, which remains on appeal.  Meanwhile, many states have adopted laws that would forbid consideration of ESG in investing state funds.  Regulators also have increasingly brought enforcement actions to address alleged greenwashing.</p>

    <section class="Public pressure"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Public pressure</h3>
    <div class="Public pressure">
        <p>Generating public pressure through media (including social media) scrutiny can be an effective route against a company wanting to preserve its ESG reputation, particularly where the goal is to prompt a change in corporate behaviour.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Complaints"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Complaints</h3>
    <div class="Complaints">
        <p>Complaints can (and may first have to) be made through a company’s internal procedure but may be more effective when submitted to a competent authority.  Outcomes can range from individual decisions to wider rulings depending on the authority and nature of the complaint.</p>

    <section class="Shareholder activism"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Shareholder activism</h3>
    <div class="Shareholder activism">
        <p>Shareholder activism can take a number of different forms, including strategic voting on resolutions, disruption at shareholder meetings, and legal claims including “derivative actions” against directors. Shareholder activism is not a new tool, but it has become a rising trend as more companies are finding themselves of the receiving end of activist campaigns.

        <p>Regulatory action depends on the industry and regulator, but can typically result in a fine, public censure and/or restrictions on the regulated company’s activities.  Some regulators (such as the Advertising Standards Authority) have already taken action under their existing rules and codes, while others (like the Financial Conduct Authority) are introducing ESG-specific requirements.</p>

    <div class="Litigation / class action">
        <p>Litigation is often the most effective route to obtaining compensation, and where multiple claimants are involved, can be brought collectively, most likely an opt-in group action or a representative action in England and Wales (with similar procedures available in Scotland and Northern Ireland). Separately, where a decision or action of a public body (or a body performing a public function) is in question, it could be subject to judicial review of its lawfulness.</p>

    <p>In the EMEA region, the following recourse routes are being employed by ESG actors and stakeholders:</p>
    <section class="Public pressure"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Public pressure</h3>
    <div class="Public pressure">
        <p>In an ESG context in the EMEA region, one major risk materialization factor lies in the increased public pressure and scrutiny from civil society over corporate activities and their potential adverse impacts on the environment or communities. With the rise of (non-financial) disclosure requirements (e.g., through the EU CSRD Directive or Deforestation Regulation), a growing number of companies must issue reports related to their business activities, which feed into a massive pool of publicly available information on how companies work towards achieving sustainability goals. NGOs and civil society more broadly are thus empowered to have access to data enabling them to take action (in various forms) to address whatever situation they believe a business should change and/or remedy.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Shareholder activism"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Shareholder activism</h3>
    <div class="Shareholder activism">
        <p>An example lies in the development across jurisdictions of shareholder’ activism, with the rise of ‘say on climate’ or ‘say on nature’ resolutions being debated during corporate general shareholders meetings. These resolutions are used by investors as tools to obtain clarifications about and influence corporate strategic plans set considering major ESG topics such as net-zero objective or other sustainability goals.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Regulatory enforcement"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Regulatory enforcement</h3>
    <div class="Regulatory enforcement">
        <p>Regulators play an ever-growing and important role in monitoring and possibly sanctioning ESG behaviors. In particular, regulators thrive to protect consumers from misleading, greenwashing, or social-washing claims about corporate products and services. The increased importance of regulatory enforcement in the EU can be illustrated by the rise in the numbers of investigations and fines, along with the development of name-and-shame practices to generate reputational harm to investigated companies. The recent adoption of the EU CS3D will only reinforce this trend.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Civil litigation"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Civil litigation</h3>
    <div class="Civil litigation">
        <p>Stakeholders also resort more frequently to civil litigation or private enforcement against companies to shed light on practices that they deem inadequate or non-compliant and seek compensation for any harm that may be suffered as a result. At the extreme, this can take the form of mass tort litigation or class actions depending on procedural rules in each jurisdiction (with the EU having adopted the Collective Action Directive, currently being implemented in Member States).</p>

    <h2 class="sub41">APAC</h2>
    <p>Unlike the EU, there is not a supranational organization which unifies APAC’s approach to ESG. This section focuses on Greater China (including Hong Kong). Broadly, in Hong Kong, ESG specific legal and regulatory developments take a sectoral approach and are centered around the financial services sector. There are few ESG specific laws in Mainland China as it already has a relatively comprehensive menu of laws and regulations in its existing arsenal to enable enforcement actions to be taken.</p>
    <section class="Representative proceedings"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Representative proceedings</h3>
    <div class="Representative proceedings">
        <p>In Hong Kong, the closest alternative to class actions comes in the form of representative proceedings. In Mainland China, there have been public-interest litigations to safeguard collective interests. In 2016, a Chinese state-backed environmental organization brought environmental public-interest litigation against the defendant for allegedly discharging excessive sewage into an evaporation pool, causing serious pollution. The Supreme People’s Court confirmed the plaintiffs' standing to sue and ordered the defendant to pay environmental restoration fees for air pollution and to publicly apologize to society in national-level media.</p>

        <p>Shareholder activism exists in Greater China but it is rare. There have been no reports of successful attempts to hold management of listed companies accountable for ESG failures either via the Courts or via board room changes.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Regulatory action"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Regulatory action</h3>
    <div class="Regulatory action">
        <p>In Hong Kong and Mainland China, regulatory action is widely considered the most effective and common recourse route.  Over the last few years, regulatory bodies have started to develop increasingly prescriptive codes, guidelines and standards, which provide a basis for regulators to take enforcement actions in the next phase of ESG development.</p>
    </div>
    <section class="Public pressure"></section>
    <h3 class="sub41">Public pressure</h3>
    <div class="Public pressure">
        <p>Public opinion, particularly in Mainland China, is another effective recourse, particularly through the use of social media. The ESG lobby has been successful in promoting low-carbon and climate-friendly corporate decisions, particularly when investors and consumers have begun to shift their investment strategies and spending habits towards ESG responsible products. Corporate disclosures are on the rise in order to improve profitability and competitiveness.</p>

    <h2 class="sub5">Stakeholders and actors</h2>
    <div class="Stakeholders and actors">
        <p>Although considering the origins of ESG risk is critical, it’s also important to look at the stakeholders and actors who might be impacted by the activities of companies and who might themselves employ various recourse routes in order to influence change:</p>
        <section class="Regulators">
        <h3 class="sub51">Regulators</h3>
        <div class="Regulators">
            <p>Global regulators, including financial, competition and advertising regulators and ombudsmen, are clear key ESG stakeholders. They translate a country’s political agenda and set policy for ESG in the financial and corporate arenas by introducing, and enforcing, ESG-related regulations. They set environmental and social ambition which is intended to stimulate sustainable finance and investment and promote integrity and credibility in sustainability markets and products. Their regulations require sustainability data to be disclosed, including climate and nature-related regimes which are intended to protect investors, consumers, the public and financial systems. Global rules and regulations can have both domestic and extra-territorial effect.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Legal – commercial parties "></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">Legal – commercial parties</h3>
        <div class="Legal – commercial parties ">
            <p>ESG has been integrated into the systems of most financial organizations and larger corporates through the introduction of ESG-related laws. This translates into new ESG policies and procedures which influence due diligence processes, investment decisions and commercial and contractual provisions. Although small and medium sized enterprises (“SMEs”) are not specifically targeted by many of these rules, they will increasingly find themselves contractually obliged to provide ESG data and assurances. How “sustainable” a company is, and the extent to which ESG has been integrated into systems and risk processes, may affect its ability to win business, raise finance and may influence the terms and cost of financing offered.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Competition authorities "></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">Competition authorities</h3>
        <div class="Competition authorities ">
            <p>On the one hand, competition authorities and advertising standards authorities, particularly in the EU and UK, have been tasked with evaluating green claims and advertisements and combatting greenwashing.  We have seen authorities uphold complaints made against advertisements in many sectors, including food, aviation and finance. Conversely, competition law has also been used in some jurisdictions, such as the US, to stifle the development of ESG alliances, suggesting that alliances set up to further net zero ambitions are anti-competitive and in breach of trust law.  So competition authorities are being used to enforce sustainability law and to prevent the application of sustainability law in those jurisdictions opposed to it.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Governments "></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">Governments</h3>
        <div class="Governments ">
            <p>Every government is unique with different combinations of politics, finances, goals, industry mix, dependence of fossil fuels and development. This influences a government’s response to ESG and their ability to act by putting in place legislation or incentivising action. The majority of governments have committed to the Paris Agreement and other international “soft law”. In order to meet these commitments, governments put in place policies and regulation in domestic law to drive certain behaviour, support the transition to net zero and achieve nature-positive outcomes. Governments do not stand alone and the decisions of individual governments may affect the competitiveness of other countries and the global financial system.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Shareholders "></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">Shareholders</h3>
        <div class="Shareholders ">
            <p>As society has become more aware of environmental and social issues, shareholders are demanding increased transparency around companies’ ESG integration and transition plans.  Shareholders have engaged with companies directly, where they have the influence, or via resolutions at AGMs to drive climate- and nature-positive action which is consistent with their own climate and nature policies. Shareholders have shown that they care about how companies are dealing with climate-related impact and the net-zero transition and are influencing markets by engaging with, and in some cases divesting from, companies based on ESG policies and action. Shareholder activism is on the rise, and ESG topics are at the top of many activist shareholders’ agendas.</p>

        <h3 class="sub51">Employees</h3>
        <div class="Employees ">
            <p>Employees are increasingly driven to work for employers which reflect their beliefs around climate change and nature.  Companies failing to integrate ESG into their business in a meaningful way will fail to attract and retain talent affecting the competitiveness of the company.  Conversely, raising ESG up the agenda and acting positively can be a positive for companies: employees who are engaged and trust their company are more motivated, less likely to be absent and more likely to stay with their employer.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Customers/clients "></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">Customers/clients</h3>
        <div class="Customers/clients ">
            <p>According to a joint study from McKinsey and NielsenIQ, US consumers are shifting their spending towards products making ESG claims and in two-thirds of categories products making ESG claims grew faster than those that didn’t.  It is clear that consumers want and will buy environmentally and socially responsible products – this is not limited to niche audiences.  Consumers and clients will give their loyalty and trust to brands which they feel are sustainable.  The flipside is that hard-won loyalty and trust is only as good as the truth behind the green claims.  In a finance context, the situation is similar as customers look for banking products, and indeed banks, which they feel are environmentally and socially responsible.</p>

        <section class="NGOs"></section>
        <h3 class="sub51">NGOs</h3>
        <div class="NGOs">
            <p>Non-governmental organisations are typically not-for-profit organisations which have the objective of improving social and/or environmental conditions.  There are a few quite high profile NGOs in the environmental sector which use methods such as environmental lobbying, litigation and business education and alliances to change culture, the “system” and potentially regulation. Over the last decade, they have become an important stakeholder of companies, both as partners and potentially contentious adversaries.</p>

                indigenous peoples: as the guardians of the nature and biodiversity, they are key stakeholders

            <h2>Environmental</h2>
            <p>Environmental risks are among the most obvious when one thinks of ESG risk, but companies can sometimes be reluctant to incur additional expense to appropriately mitigate their environmental impact. However, prioritizing cash flow over long-term sustainability has its own risks, including:</p>

            <h3 class="sub61">Social and economic instability</h3>
            <div class="Social and economic instability ">
                <p>Companies depend on social well-being and prosperity as a baseline for operations. Yet, society depends on biodiversity and ecosystem services to maintain stability. Declines in environmental integrity are poised to incur additional economic risk through shortages and increased costs that will impact the economy on both micro and macro levels.</p>

            <div class="Resource scarcity ">
                <p>Progressive destruction such as deforestation or increases in greenhouse gases and pollution mean that important nature resources and services (such as water availability, pollination and soil fertility) are increasingly impacted. This will have a knock-on impact throughout the supply chain and the economy. Even if a business model does not depend on immediate access to natural resources, they will make an appearance at some point in any supply chain, and inaccessibility to these resources will inevitably have a negative impact.</p>

The following should be on the radar of every company:</p>

            <div class="Pay inequality">
                <p>Inappropriate use of historic pay data, reliance on the individual to negotiate pay increases and use of subjective criteria when determining pay increases and decisions on career progression can contribute towards pay inequality. Pay inequality among certain protected groups for the same work is unlawful in many countries, together with impacting on the recruitment and retention of diverse talent.</p>

                <p>Failure to take measures to address disproportionately low levels of participation among groups with protected characteristics can have a knock-on effect on recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce and the talent pipeline. This increases the risk of “groupthink” and may impact investment and innovation. Conversely, disproportionate action to address these issues can create legal risks and result in litigation/class actions, so companies need to cast a thoughtful eye on their choices in this space.</p>

        <h2>Governance</h2>
        <p>Developing and implementing robust governance practices that mitigate the many ESG risks in this space allows companies to strengthen their resilience, competitiveness, and reputation in an increasingly complex and interconnected business environment. Some of the risks for organizations to consider include:</p>
        <section class="Lack of risk assessment">
        <h3 class="sub61">Lack of risk assessment</h3>
        <div class="Lack of risk assessment">
            <p>Unless companies understand the inherent and residual compliance risks that their businesses face it is impossible to implement appropriate and effective policies and procedures that help prevent wrongdoing in any sphere.</p>

        <h3 class="sub61">Policies without culture</h3>
        <div class="Policies without culture">
            <p>If policies and procedures are imposed without effective implementation, monitoring, or senior leadership buy-in they will fail to achieve their aims. Furthermore, enforcement agencies and regulators are unlikely to give any credit for a compliance program where any aspect of implementation is defective.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Failure to prevent financial crime"></section>
        <h3 class="sub61">Failure to prevent financial crime</h3>
        <div class="Failure to prevent financial crime">
            <p>Bribery, corruption, fraud and money-laundering risk undermine business efficacy but also exposes businesses (and in some cases, their senior management) to criminal risk. In many jurisdictions failing to prevent bribery or fraud in a company’s own operations and also those of any business partners gives rise to material legal risk. Good governance is crucial in mitigating this risk and can often act as a legal defense to prosecution or regulatory action.</p>
        </div>
        <section class="Failure to prevent and mitigate human rights/environmental impacts"></section>
        <h3 class="sub61">Failure to prevent and mitigate human rights/environmental impacts</h3>
        <div class="Failure to prevent and mitigate human rights/environmental impacts">
            <p>As with financial crime, failing to understand how a company’s operations create adverse human rights or environmental impacts and failing to mitigate such risks gives rise to some very material legal risk – both criminal and civil. In this regard, understanding the company’s supply chain is crucial. Increasingly, regulation around the world is imposing additional governance obligations on companies (and their senior management) in respect to their supply chains including very expansive new rules on supply chain due diligence.</p>

        <h3 class="sub61">Avoid silos and resource teams appropriately</h3>
        <div class="Avoid silos and resource teams appropriately ">
            <p>Compliance with environmental, human rights and financial crime laws should be approached holistically. It makes sense from a resource perspective but also because corruption can give rise to environmental or human rights issues and vice versa. It is also important to ensure that compliance functions are treated with appropriate financial and management support. Avoiding risk should be rewarded as much as taking risk.</p>

            <div class="Energy transition in emerging markets">
                <p>Commitments to decarbonise the power sector to help achieve net zero outcomes by 2050 present unique challenges for governments and power producers in emerging markets who are simultaneously pursuing economic growth to advance the living conditions of their people. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the majority of the world’s energy poor are living in Asia and the Pacific. More than 350 million people in the region have only limited access to electricity and 150 million people still have no access to electricity at all.</p>
                <p>Over the past 30 years, substantial investment has been made in developing base load power generation capacity in Asia to support economic growth. This has relied heavily on fossil fuels, primarily coal and gas.</p>
                <p>Financing for these projects has been reliant on export credit agencies and development banks, who have provided long term, stable, and economic sources of finance for these projects.  This financing has encouraged commercial lenders and other private sources of capital to underwrite the substantial investment in power generation capacity in these emerging markets.</p>
                <p>Financial institutions and investors (both public and private), have come under increasing pressure from shareholders, civil society organizations and their own governments to withdraw financial support for power projects relying on fossil fuels.  Some public sector funders, such as the Asian Development Bank, have publicly stated that they will not fund new coal-fired power projects – others have noticeably reduced their support for new coal-fired generation, even if they have not publicly committed to no new funding.</p>
                <p>The end result is that there are now very limited sources of debt and equity finance for any new coal fired power projects in the region, notwithstanding a number of governments are still contemplating the addition of further coal fired generation as part of their future power development plans.</p>
                <p>While the focus to date has been on lenders withdrawing support for new coal-fired power projects, there remains a risk that support for existing projects may also be withdrawn. To date this has not been observed at the project level, but there are certainly examples of lenders withdrawing support for corporate level facilities. Power developers should remain vigilant to the ongoing risk of project level financing being affected in the future and consider whether strategies can be put in place to mitigate such risk.</p>
                <p>Recognizing these challenges, the ADB has recently announced an Energy Transition Mechanism, which will financially support the early retirement of coal fired generation capacity.  The first project, located in Indonesia, has been identified and ADB hopes to successfully reach agreement with the Indonesian Government, the power producer and their lenders within 2024.  It is hoped that this initial project, if successfully closed, can provide a blueprint for the early retirement of other coal fired generation capacity in the region, with replacement sustainable energy sources, thus ensuring that the replacement of coal fired generating capacity does not come at the expense of socioeconomic development in emerging markets.</p>

                <p>Energy is central to inclusive socioeconomic development, but the expansion of energy systems has come at the cost of harmful impacts on our climate and environment. ADB’s new energy policy will support our developing member countries (DMCs) in the critical and urgent task of expanding access to reliable, affordable, and clean energy. This new policy locks in our strong commitment that ADB will not fund new coal power production. Together with our elevated ambition to deliver $100 billion in climate financing to our DMCs in 2019–2030, it provides a clear path for ADB’s contribution to an environmentally sustainable energy future.”</p>

            <h3 class="sub71">Climate change</h3>
            <div class="Climate change">
                  <p>Climate change is an issue that is demanding action across the economy.  While each industry sector will face its own specific challenges, all companies must contend with issues that include the cost of directly controlling greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions without an assist from new technology, the challenge of offsetting emissions that cannot be controlled through third-party actions, and the intense level of scrutiny now being leveled against most, if not all, assertions a company makes about its climate action plan.</p>
                  <p>Government has the potential to be the “heavy hand” in this uncertain environment, but the choices it faces are likewise difficult. It can be hard to obtain political buy-in for limits on GHG emissions, in part because such limits risk creating an unacceptable near-term drag on the economy that is particularly tough on those who must stand for re-election. Identifying the most effective incentive programs is not necessarily straightforward, and there is a lag between incentivizing reductions and achieving them.  Additionally, incentives can be quite costly and beyond the reach of many governments. Government action is susceptible to changes in the political winds, which may create foot-dragging among regulated entities, although large, generous incentives may be too tempting to pass up and hard to end once they are in place.</p>  
                  <p>With this sweeping array of challenges, what is most encouraging is the recognition across the global economy that business as usual is not an option.  Political and commercial consensus around the urgent need for climate action is emerging.</p>
                  <p>Spurred on by government incentives, private investments are pouring into climate-friendly technologies at an unprecedented level, and those embracing change are showing others the way. Additionally, the ability to export emissions-creation is declining as more governments accept the need for climate controls. Technologies thought to be far in the future are coming to market.  A hydrogen fuel economy, large-scale energy storage, and maybe even fusion, to name just a few new technologies, are no longer distant dreams.</p>
                  <p>So what climate-responsive strategies are available to organizations?  Among them are ongoing engagement in regulatory processes, as climate is not a “one and done” proposition.  Businesses are also taking a careful look at new technologies and the unprecedented levels of government support for them, recognizing the need to take advantage of incentives while they are available and learning to accept the accompanying policy “strings.”</p>
                  <p>Businesses are also finding new partners with whom to collaborate on climate strategies because going it alone may make it harder than it has to be. They are learning to bring realism to their climate strategies.  They understand that, if they over-promise, they are likely to under-deliver. Finally, they are recognizing that getting started is key to avoid being left behind by competitors.</p>

            <h3 class="sub71">ESG risk in Germany</h3>
            <div class="ESG risk in Germany">
                  <p>In Germany, public scrutiny of an organization’s ESG stance and actions are increasingly intense,  creating a quickly evolving regulatory ESG landscape that is transforming former “soft” law to “hard” law and accompanied by expanding enforcement activities.</p> 
                  <p>In Europe, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (“SCDDA”) forms the spearhead of ESG compliance requirements and enforcement. The SCDDA requires companies with a local nexus to and over 1,000 employees in Germany to implement a comprehensive human rights and environmental risk management system. This includes inter alia,</p>  
                  <li>the appointment of a human rights officer</li>
                  <li>a risk analysis</li>
                  <li>preventive measures and a grievance mechanism</li>
                  <li>remedial actions in case of suspected violations</li>
                  <p>Companies also have to issue annual reports on their efforts which are submitted to the enforcement authority and must be published on the companies’ website.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate this environment, a manufacturer of tech products recently came under fire for allegations of forced labor in its supply chain. NGOs in a specific region in China have pointed to a potential significant human rights violation and accused the company of forced labor at its suppliers.</p>
                  <p>Due to this suspicion, the enforcement authority approached the company with a formal request for information to establish the facts of the case. The responses of the authority to this suspicion can have significant ramifications for the company, both financially and legally.</p>
                  <p>The potential consequences of inadequate human rights risk management are substantial. Aside from reputational damage, companies risk fines up to 2% of their global annual turnover for non-compliance. While to date there is no civil liability for breaches of SCDDA obligations, this will change with the adoption of the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CS3D”) into national law. Criminal risks are also increasing with new legislation ahead and intensified enforcement.</p>
                  <p>Cases like this underscore the urgency and complexity of ESG risks in global supply chains. To effectively address the various risks, strong compliance processes are vital. Companies must take measures and implement appropriate risk management strategies to mitigate legal, financial and reputational risks. Companies with operations in Germany can consider the SCDDA as a blue print for compliance with the upcoming CS3D by implementing an effective risk management system as the basis for risk-based and appropriate measures to prevent human rights violations.</p>

            <h3 class="sub71">ESG risk in Latin America</h3>
            <div class="ESG risk in Latin America">
                <p>In recent years, ESG considerations have gained prominence in global investment decisions. However, alongside this sustainability focus, instances of greenwashing are increasing, raising doubts about the authenticity of corporate ESG practices. Latin America, known for its rich biodiversity and socio-economic diversity, provides a compelling case study on ESG risks, including the deceptive practice of greenwashing.</p>
                <p>A significant ESG risk in Latin America results from its economic dependence on industries with substantial environmental footprints. Countries like Brazil and Mexico exemplify this reliance, with extractive industries often facing criticism for habitat destruction. Given the growing sustainability pressure, some corporations resort to greenwashing, portraying false environmental commitments while continuing unsustainable practices.</p>
                <p>Mexico faces the challenge of balancing economic development with environmental preservation. Consequently, it has issued a series of public policies and legislation including a "Sustainable Taxonomy" guideline to categorize sustainable activities, aiding ESG risk management by offering clarity and investment guidance. Expansion of these guidelines is anticipated to ensure companies understand sustainable activity criteria.</p>
                <p>One notable case of greenwashing in 2019, involved Greenpeace Mexico accusing a major fashion retailer of failing to provide transparency regarding its environmental impact. Despite claiming sustainability measures, the retailer did not disclose material usage in its products. This case underscored the challenges of verifying corporate claims of environmental responsibility and prompted public scrutiny of sustainability efforts within Mexico's fashion industry.</p>
                <p>Similarly, Brazil faces ESG risks from deforestation and land degradation, primarily driven by agricultural expansion and logging activities. While agribusinesses promote sustainability initiatives, reports of illegal deforestation and land grabbing reveal the prevalence of greenwashing. Resultingly, Brazil has implemented policies to combat deforestation, including increased monitoring and enforcement efforts along with engagement in international partnerships and initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development.</p>
                <p>For instance, in 2010, a multinational energy corporation faced allegations of greenwashing after portraying itself as environmentally responsible while engaging in controversial projects, such as deep-water oil drilling in ecologically sensitive areas like the Amazon Rainforest. This case sparked debate about corporate transparency and environmental stewardship in Brazil's energy sector.</p>
                <p>The above evidences how addressing ESG risks in Latin America demands a multifaceted approach involving regulatory reforms, stakeholder engagement, and enhanced transparency. Governments must enforce stringent environmental regulations and incentivize sustainable practices. Collaboration between corporations, civil society, and local communities is vital for genuine ESG integration and curbing the prevalence of greenwashing.</p>

            <h3 class="sub71">Greenwashing risk in the United States</h3>
            <div class="Greenwashing risk in the United States">
                <p>Increased consumer attention to corporate environmental practices – particularly related to global warming and net zero claims – has increased regulatory scrutiny and the risk of greenwashing enforcement actions by state attorneys general, local prosecutors, and administrative agencies with relevant jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>This rapidly emerging risk is illustrated by New York v. JBS US Food Company et al., N.Y. Sup. Ct. Case No. 450682/2024 (February 28, 2024), where the New York Attorney General (“AG”) filed a complaint against the American subsidiary of the largest beef producer in the world alleging that the company repeatedly mislead the public about its environmental impact.</p>
                <p>The core of the complaint alleges that beef production has “the highest total greenhouse gas emissions of any major food commodity” and yet JBS allegedly made “sweeping representations to consumers about its commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, claiming it will be ‘Net Zero by 2040.’” Despite its broad claims, according to the complaint the company had “no viable plan to meet its commitment to be ‘Net Zero by 2040.’” Citing to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the AG alleges that the company was driven to make false statements because it knew that if it was perceived to produce “unsustainable” beef product, consumer demand would be harmed and its share of the U.S. beef market would decline.</p>
                <p>The company’s “Net Zero by 2040” claims, according to the AG, were made “without having calculated the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from its supply chain” or taking into account deforestation in the Amazon associated with its supply chain.  In fact, the AG’s position is that there “are no proven agricultural practices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero at the [company’s] current scale” and that offsetting emissions of such magnitude would be unprecedented. As such, even a “pledge” to reach net-zero at a distant point in the future – like 2040 – was deceptive because, according to the AG, it was neither feasible nor based upon a defined plan of action.</p>
                <p>The complaint points to numerous alleged misrepresentations by the company about “Net Zero by 2040” made in multiple media, under a variety of contexts, including (i) on company websites, with particular focus on statements such as being “the first global meat and poultry company to pledge to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040,” (ii) published sustainability reports, (iii) statements by the CEO at climate-related conferences, and (iv) a full page ad in the New York Times.</p>
                <p>In making these, and other, statements, the AG alleges that JBS repeatedly: (i) undertook deceptive acts and practices, by making misrepresentations about greenhouse gas emissions, in violation of General Business Law § 349, (ii) violated General Business Law § 350 by engaging in false advertising on the web and online publications related to achieving net zero emissions by 2040, and (iii) violated Executive Law § 63(12) by engaging in repeated or persistent fraudulent or illegal conduct related to statements claiming the company would achieve net zero by 2040. The complaint asks for broad relief, including an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten profits, equitable relief, civil penalties ranging from $1,000 - $5,000 per violation (i.e., per misrepresentation), independent audits, and attorneys’ fees.</p>
                <p>The case provides several cautionary insights. First, merely making a “pledge” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over a period of years – as opposed to falsely claiming such reductions have already occurred – will not protect companies from potential enforcement.  Absent a defined, reasonable plan of action that is deemed feasible by regulators, enforcement alleging that an abstract pledge is deceptive is a real potential.  And, second, regulators will look across a swath of media – including advertising, websites, sustainability reports, SEC reporting, press releases, and public statements, speeches, and interviews by senior management – to build a potential case alleging a pattern of deceptive, misleading, and false claims.</p>
